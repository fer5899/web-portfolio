        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            These delicious teriyaki chicken wings are a hit at every party! 
            I made 10 pounds of these wings for a recent get-together, and 
            not one wing was left at the end of the night.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>1 cup of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup of pineapple juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of minced fresh garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>3 pounds of chicken wings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk water, soy sauce, sugar, pineapple juice, vegetable oil, 
                garlic, and ginger together in a large glass or ceramic bowl 
                until sugar has dissolved. Add chicken wings and toss to evenly coat. 
                Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator 
                for at least 1 hour.
            </li>

            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease baking dishes and set them aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove chicken wings from marinade; shake off excess and place the 
                chicken wings into the prepared baking dishes. Discard the 
                remaining marinade.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake chicken wings in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked 
                through and glaze is evenly browned, about 1 hour. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
                165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
