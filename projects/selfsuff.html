        <h3>Summary of the project</h3>
        <p>
            
            During the first three months of my internship for Ubora Solar Solvers I managed
            to develop from the ground up a local-running program in python that is now 
            integrated in the workflow of the company's engineers.
        
        </p>

        <p>

            The Self-sufficiency calculator is a program that dramatically speeds up and 
            increases the accuracy of the estimation process needed to correctly size a solar 
            panel installation based on the specific needs of each client. In summary, it first gathers
            the needed hourly irradiation data based on the position of the target installation
            contacting the PVGis API. It then processes that information with the parameters 
            specified by the engineers to output a graph that shows the engineers the
            self-sufficiency obtained with different arrays of panels and batteries. This graph
            contains the needed information for the engineers to make the decision about the number
            of panels and batteries that are optimal for a given installation based on its client's 
            needs.

        </p>

        <p>

            The frontend was designed using PyQt and it consisted of a simple formulary-like interface 
            to input the needed parameters and of graphs made using the matplotlib library. In the
            background, concurrent processes had to run to get the info from the API, to access excel
            documents and to make time consuming iterative calculations.

        </p>
        

        <h3>Experience acquired with it</h3>
        
        <p>
            As there was no other programmer in the company, it was up to me to analyze what 
            was needed to optimize, to design the solution, to test it, and to implement it. This has
            led me to get deeply familiarized with the product design process, to improve my soft-skills 
            related to the communication with the client for the product design and to boost my
            self-learning abilities.
        
        </p>

        <p>

            After this project, I have become quite fluent in Python programming and I have consolidated
            many core concepts of object oriented programming as well as getting quite comfortable with
            the use of concurrency to speed up processes.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>

            I have learned how to create a frontend with Qt and have extracted some core ideas and
            practices that could be translated to other languages or libraries.
