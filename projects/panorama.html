        <h3>Summary of the project</h3>
        <p>
            This program was created as the final project for the Computer Vision class in Brno University of Technology.
            In that class we learned about many different concepts that applied in computer vision and I had to
            specialize in one of them and create an application. I chose Feature Recognition and to show what I had 
            learnt I developed this panorama image creator.
        </p>

        <p>
            This whole project is developed in Python and it fundamentally uses the libraries OpenCV and Numpy for 
            image handling. This program takes an ordered set of photos that from left to right share certain overlap,
            and the program merges the images to form one panorama image. The program is executed from the command line
            and takes as arguments the folder with the input photos and the folder where it will output the panorama.
        </p>

        <p>
            The program follows these steps to create a panorama image from the inputs:
            
            <ol>
                <li>Read the images from the input folder.</li>

                <li>Find the keypoints and their respective descriptors of each image.</li>

                <li>
                    Look for the two best correspondences of each keypoint between pairs of consecutive images 
                    using brute force algorithm. A ratio test is applied between the two best correspondences, if one
                    is significantly better match than the other, that match is stored.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Find the homography matrix between each pair of images using the correspondences just found, using
                    RANSAC algorithm to get rid of outliers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Transform all the homography matrices to be referenced to the center's image homography matrix.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Find the max coordinates of the to be warped images using the homography matrices to create a blank
                    canvas that can fit them all once they are merged.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Warp each image, interpolating when necessary, according to their homography matrices and fit them
                    in the blank canvas.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Experience acquired</h3>
        
        <p>
            By developing this program I have gotten comfortable with image manipulation, specially using OpenCV and
            Numpy. My overall fluency with Python improved as well and I started to deal with efficiency in code. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I have greatly interiorized important concepts in Computer Vision such as keypoints, descriptors, feature 
            matching and homography matrices.
