        <h3>Summary of the project</h3>
        <p>
            This system was created as my end-of-degree project in the University of MÃ¡laga. The aim of this project was
            to implement a system that would allow some doors with electric locks to be opened using registered RFID 
            tags. The designed system keeps track of the registered RFID tags storing them as users in a MongoDB database. 
            These users can be added, updated or deleted through a web interface designed and run in Node-RED. It also 
            stores in the database all the attempted accesses, and these are also easily visualized through this web 
            interface. Users can also be added and deleted directly at the reader if a card with administrator 
            permissions is passed. A state machine was designed in Node-RED to implement that function.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system is composed of two main elements, the central node and the reader node.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The central node is controlled by a Raspberry Pi in which the local MongoDB database and the control 
                    logic in Node-RED runs. The Raspberry Pi is connected via serial port to a NodeMCU board which uses 
                    to communicate to the reader nodes through ESP-NOW, which enables the system to work without the need 
                    of Wifi connection access. The Raspberry Pi needs internet access, which can be provided via ethernet 
                    cable if Wifi connection isn't available, in order to access the web interface.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The reader node is controlled by a NodeMCU board which manages the readings from a RC522 RFID reader, 
                    the visual feedback red and green leds and a relay used to open the electrical lock of the door to 
                    access. The reader node communicates through ESP-NOW the readings to the central node and recieves 
                    from it the corresponding response behavior. The system is built so up to 19 reader nodes can be 
                    working at the same time, due to ESP-NOW limitations.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Experience acquired</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                During the project I got quite comfortable with Node-RED, and using this tool also led me to improve my
                JavaScript programming skills.
            </li>

            <li>
                I learned how to work with NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
            </li>

            <li>
                Improved my Arduino coding skills by programming the NodeMCU boards.
            </li>
        </ul>
