        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds zucchini, grated</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Toss zucchini and salt together in a large colander 
                and place in sink to drain for 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Transfer zucchini to the center of a piece of cheesecloth; 
                wrap cheesecloth around zucchini and squeeze to drain 
                as much moisture as possible.
            </li>

            <li>
                Mix flour, Parmesan cheese, egg, and garlic together 
                in a large bowl. Stir in zucchini, then season with 
                kosher salt and pepper.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
            </li>

            <li>
                Working in batches, scoop tablespoonfuls of zucchini 
                mixture into the hot skillet and fry until golden brown, 
                about 2 minutes per side.
            </li>
        </ol>
