        <h3>Summary of the project</h3>
        <p>
            This project was created for the Robotics Lab class in the University of MÃ¡laga in collaboration with
            two classmates. The aim of the project was to create a mobile robot capable of following preprogrammed 
            trajectories with precision, and have it avoid obstacles and then return to the assigned trajectory by itself.
            During the development of this project many concepts of control theory and robotics were put into practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mobile robot physically consisted of a couple motors with encoders that would control the movement, 
            a free directional wheel, a couple sonar sensors for obstacle avoidance, three batteries as power source 
            and an Arduino Mega as the central processor unit, all mounted onto a wooden board. Some pieces were designed
            and 3D printed for attaching the motors and the sonar sensors. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Matlab and Simulink were used to program and model the behavior of the robot and its parts. To achieve our
            goal, we set several tasks that in time gradually increased the complexity of the robot and helped us achieve
            our main goal. 
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                For the first task our goal was to have the robot move proportionally to the signals of the sonar
                sensors. That way, if there were no obstacles detected by either of the sensors, the robot would move 
                straight, but if it detected any obstacles from any of the sides, the opposite wheel would turn slower
                making the robot turn away from the obstacle. This control method was flawed and not useful, 
                but it was easy to develop and got the robot mounted and moving.
            </li>

            <li>
                Our next goal was to get the encoders working and using that movement feedback to model the model
                the motors. For that, we had to create an Arduino code that read the encoder signals as interrupts and 
                outputted that to our simulink model converted to distance and speed. Once we had the encoders working,
                we programmed some simple movement of the motors with Simulink's signal builder, and using the recorded
                real movement obtained with the encoders we modelled the motors using Simulink's system identification
                tool. Having the motor models we could then simulate its behavior, greatly reducing testing times further
                down the line.
            </li>

            <li>
                With the motors modelled, the next task was to create a closed loop control in order to control the robot
                by giving it a speed input for each of the individual wheels, instead of the previous PWM input, and to 
                have it automatically adjust and compensate for any external perturbations. For that we designed and 
                tested a PID controller for each motor that we added to the system's plant.
            </li>

            <li>
                In order further advance towards our goal of a robot that follows a preprogrammed path, we had now to 
                implement the odometry system and centralize the speed input. Using the distance between the wheels 
                we applied inverse kinematics to transform the speed input from linear velocity and angular velocity of the 
                robot to velocity of the left and right wheel. With that, we had centralized the speed input. Then, we 
                applied direct kinematics to transform the two wheels velocities read by the encoders to linear and 
                angular velocity. To finalize the Odometry, we decomposed the linear velocity into "x" and "y" velocities
                and then, with the angular velocity, integrated them in time to obtain the position and orientation of 
                the robot while it moved.
            </li>

            <li>
                With the odometry implemented, we tried the system adding a PID that controlled the angle and a feedback
                loop that kept it following the setpoint given. Now the robot could follow a straight line and keep 
                its orientation.
            </li>

            <li>
                The next goal was to have the robot follow a trajectory set by giving an array of XY points. For that,
                we had to program a block in Matlab using the PurePursuit strategy. The idea of the block coded is that 
                the robot constantly calculates the orientation that it needs to set itself to to get to the next point
                by comparing the current position obtained with the odometry system and the target position. The
                PurePursuit strategy comes into play when the robot is approaching the target point. To not have the 
                robot spin in circles trying to exactly get to the specified point, and to give it some space to make a
                safe turn, when the robot has gotten close enough to the target point, it switches to the next one.
            </li>

            <li>
                Lastly, we created a state machine with Simulink's State Flow that would take over the normal PurePursuit
                functions and deviate the trajectory away whenever an obstacle was detected on any of the sensors. Once 
                the obstacle was no longer detected, the normal PurePursuit would try again to reach the next setpoint.
            </li>

        </ol>

                I practiced and deeply understood some core concepts of control theory and robotics, and their use,
                by directly applying them to model the system that we had to later control.

                project.
